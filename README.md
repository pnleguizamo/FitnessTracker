# FitnessTracker
This is my Fitness Progress Tracker. The program creates a JSON file using the attached text file to easily analyze and visualize my strength training progress since the beginning of 2022. Every lifting session, I track how many sets, reps, and how much weight I do for each exercise. By using string manipulation and storing this data in a JSON file, the Python script creates and displays a graph showing an estimated 1 rep max for the chosen exercise on each specific date. 

The graph also displays my bodyweight over time, and highlights bulking and cutting periods.
