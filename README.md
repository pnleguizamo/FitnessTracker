# FitnessTracker
This is my Fitness Progress Tracker. The program uses the attached text file to analyze and visualize my strength training progress since the beginning of 2022. Every lifting session, I track how many sets, reps, and how much weight I do for each exercise. By using string manipulation and storing this data in structures, the JavaScript program outputs a bar graph to the console, with each index on the graph corresponding to a one rep max for an exercise of choice on that specific date. 

The program will print relevant exercises that appear the most in my workout record. Some exercises that provide satisfactory bar graph results are Bench, Squat, OHP, RDL, Incline DB Press, and Cable Row, among others.
